# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

A simple implementation of linear regression using gradient descent for optimization.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression using gradient descent to find the best-fitting line for a given dataset. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing results, optional)

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
